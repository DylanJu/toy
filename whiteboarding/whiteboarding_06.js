// Write an efficient function that checks whether any permutation of an input string is a palindrome.
// A permutation is an ordering of a set of items.
//
// Example: all permutations of 'tom':
//
// tom
// tmo
// omt
// otm
// mto
// mot
//
// Not to be confused with a combination, which is an unordered set or subset.
//
// Examples:
//
// "civic" should return true
// "ivicc" should return true
// "civil" should return false
// "livci" should return false
//
// "But 'ivicc' isn't a palindrome!"
// If you had this thought, read the question again carefully. We're asking if any permutation of the string is a palindrome. Spend some extra time ensuring you fully understand the question before starting. Jumping in with a flawed understanding of the problem doesn't look good in an interview.
//
// Gotchas
// We can do this in O(n) time.
